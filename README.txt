Elevator Simulation:

1) How to Compile and Run Simulation:
    1. Open terminal
    2. Navigate to the directory containing the source files
    3. Compile the project using a C++ compiler 
        g++ main.cpp elevator.cpp building.cpp -o elevator_project
    4. Run program
        ./elevator_project
