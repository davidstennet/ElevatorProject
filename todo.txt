we should have a loop in main that goes until the person gets off the Elevator
Should also add some sort of print delay so the elevator goes up or down slowly



Elevator class
Data Members:
int capacity
int numberOfPeople
int direction (1 for up 0 for down)
int numberOfFloors
int nextFloor
int currentFloor
int[numberOfFloors] pressedFloors
----------------------------
printElevator() functin that prints the building with current floor you are on

5 | [Elevator]
4 |
3 |
2 |
1 |
